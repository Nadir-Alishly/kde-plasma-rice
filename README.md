# Kde Plasma rice

This is step by step guide to my kde plasma rice / customization. This guide is modular and does not require every step to be exactly same, feel free to experiment and mish mash your preferred options, this is possible thanks to KDE's modular and flexible structure.

## My Setup

- Kernel: 6.6.4
- Distribution: Arch Linux
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma (X11)
- Window Manager: KWin
- GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti Mobile

## Wallpaper

As for wallpapers I found very talanted artist Abyss and used their anime styled landscape wallpaper, [here is link to their page](https://alphacoders.com/users/profile/283455/Abyss). You can find my selection of Abyss's wallpapers in `/wallpapers` directory.

To set wallpapers, right click on desktop and select "Configure Desktop and Wallpaper". Select "folder view" for "layout", "wallpaper type" as "slideshow", "positioning" as "scaled and cropped". Set "order" and "change every" options as you like, my preference is random every 1 hour.
